# TODO

- embed prompts in metadata

- Convert insights into actual executables -> preconfigured combinations
of: Style + LoRAs + Prompts
- How to make them nicely composable?
- extract nice presets from past generated prompts

# Insights

- Watercolor style + 0.5 pencil LoRA
- Technically color very accurate 0.5
- Technically color + pencil sketch works somewhat
- Digital art seems bad
- Anime style lacks people
