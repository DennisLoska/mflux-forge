  Generate ${Config.IMAGE.count} images of ${options.title} using stable diffusion.

  FOR ALL PROMPTS ALWAYS:
  ${options.description}

  Keeping aforementioned instructions in mind create the image generation prompts for me by using
  the following instructions as a template:

  ${options.style.secondary} [primary style: ${options.style.primary}],
  [texture: ${options.style.texture}], [subject & focal point], [setting & composition],
  [light & atmosphere], [palette], [techniques & edges], [mood adjectives], [finegranular texture] 

  Examples styles to use:

  ${JSON.stringify(options.style.styles)}

  Examples scenes for reference only:

  ${JSON.stringify(options.scenes)}

  Use these example scenes only as reference, but never use these exact examples.
  Instead come up with a completely new variety of different scenes for the list of prompts.

  Tips:
  - Front-load the most important elements (subject + medium first)
  - ~50-250 words tends to be the sweet spot
  - Prefer concrete subjects over abstract descriptions

  Create a file called ${options.name}_${Config.now}.txt in ${Config.DIR}/prompts and save all prompts there.

  Make sure that you only write one prompt per line!
  Prefix each line with the name of the file.

  Example line: unique_descriptive_image_name.png My awesome image prompt goes here
  Make sure that no line is empty!
